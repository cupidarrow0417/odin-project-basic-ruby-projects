## Caeser Cipher
### Information
The caeser cipher is long used cipher in cryptography, traced by to Julius Caeser and his personal correspondance (hence the name). According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher):
> In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

In this project, the caeser cipher is implemented using Ruby. This project is part of The Odin Project Javascript curriculum. The project information can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/caesar-cipher).
### Project Status
At this time, the project is __*finished*__.
### Instructions
To use this program, Ruby will need to be installed. This program is build on Ruby v2.6.5p114. To check your current version:
```
ruby -v
```
If you have a compatible version, this program can be run using this command:
```
ruby caeser-cipher.rb
```
This program does have user input capabilities, however they have not been completely tested.
